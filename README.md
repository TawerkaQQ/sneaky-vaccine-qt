## The module is designed for manual image marking via opencv or pyside6.

To start the markup process, you need to pass two paths to the `src/opencv_markups.py` module:

    1. The path to the images that need markup

    2. The path to the location where the resulting markup and images will be saved

Then, run the following command in the terminal:
`uv run src/opencv_markups.py`
